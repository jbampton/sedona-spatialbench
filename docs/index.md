SpatialBench is a benchmark for assessing geospatial SQL analytics query performance across database systems.

SpatialBench makes it easy to run spatial benchmarks on a realistic dataset with any query engine.

The methodology is unbiased and the benchmarks in any environment to compare relative performance between runtimes.

## Why SpatialBench

SpatialBench is a geospatial benchmark for testing and optimizing spatial analytical query performance in database systems. Inspired by the SSB and NYC taxi data, it combines realistic urban mobility scenarios with a star schema extended with spatial attributes like pickup/dropoff points, zones, and building footprints.

This design enables evaluation of the following geospatial operations:

* spatial joins
* distance queries
* aggregations
* point-in-polygon analysis

Let’s dive into the advantages of SpatialBench.

## Key advantages

* Uses spatial datasets with geometry columns.
* Includes queries with different spatial predicates.
* Easily reproducible results.
* Includes a dataset generator to so results are reproducible.
* The scale factors of the datasets can be changed so that you can run the queries locally, in a data warehouse, or on a large cluster in the cloud.
* All the specifications used to run the benchmarks are documented, and the methodology is unbiased.
* The code is open source, allowing the community to provide feedback and keep the benchmarks up-to-date and reliable over time.

## Generate synthetic data

Here’s how you can install the synthetic data generator:

```
cargo install --path ./spatialbench-cli
```

Here’s how you can generate the synthetic dataset:

```
spatialbench-cli -s 1 --format=parquet
```

See the project repository [README](https://github.com/apache/sedona-spatialbench) for the complete set of straightforward data generation instructions.

## Example query

Here’s an example query that counts the number of trips that start within 500 meters of each building:

```sql
SELECT
    b.b_buildingkey,
    b.b_name,
    COUNT(*) AS nearby_pickup_count
FROM trip t
JOIN building b
ON ST_DWithin(t.t_pickup_loc, b.b_boundary, 500)
GROUP BY b.b_buildingkey, b.b_name
ORDER BY nearby_pickup_count DESC;
```

This query performs a distance join, followed by an aggregation.  It’s a great example of a query that’s useful for performance benchmarking a spatial engine that can process vector geometries.
